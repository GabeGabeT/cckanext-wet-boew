          Organizations act like publishing departments for datasets (for
          example, the Department of Health). This means that datasets can be
          published by and belong to a department instead of an individual
          user.<br><br>
          Within organizations, admins can assign roles and authorisation its
          members, giving individual users the right to publish datasets from
          that particular organisation (e.g. Office of National Statistics).
